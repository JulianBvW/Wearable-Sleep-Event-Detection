\section{Dataset}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain MESA (what Patients, how did they record the nights, ...)
    \item Statistical analysis (Count, Age, ...)
    \item Scorings from SOMNOLYZER (OSA, HYP, ...)
    \item Kappa between NSRR and SOMNOLYZER
    \item Use predicted Hypnogram (maybe?) and their Kappa
\end{itemize}

\section{Preprocessing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item PPG [256Hz], SpO2 [1Hz], Hypnogram [1Hz]
    \item For PPG: Statistical Analysis, Denoising, VAE?, Conv-Block
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Architecture}

\begin{itemize}
    \item U-Net (with PPG Conv-Block), Batch-Norm, Attention, ...
    \item Output: Detection at 1Hz - Event vs No Event
    \item TODO Next model then classifies into SDB classes
\end{itemize}

\section{Training and Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Training Parameters (Optimizer, LR, BS, ...) and Setup (Machines, ...)
    \item Seed and Cross-Validation
    \item Train on 30min (?) segments. For Testing: Concat 30min Windows with Overlap for full night result.
    \item Correct results (like Olsen, 10sec minimum event and distance between events)
    \item Event-based metrics (Se, Pr, F1) and when to count TP, TN, FP, FN
    \item AHI-based metric (Linear Correlation, Severity Classes, Near-Boundary Double-Classification)
\end{itemize}
