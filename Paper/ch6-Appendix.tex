\chapter{Appendix \label{Chapter-Appendix}}

Todos:
\begin{itemize}
    \item should I show an example of the models output %https://github.com/JulianBvW/Wearable-Sleep-Event-Detection/blob/main/Notebooks/32_look_at_outputs.ipynb
    \item should I talk about the denoising techniques? should I show an example of them? Or just the one I used (lowpass)? Results are without cross validation %https://github.com/JulianBvW/Wearable-Sleep-Event-Detection/blob/main/Notebooks/38_frequency_filters.ipynb
    \item don't show the kfold balancing analysis, right? table was enough %https://github.com/JulianBvW/Wearable-Sleep-Event-Detection/blob/main/Notebooks/44_kfold_generator.ipynb
    \item Evaluation per Sleep Stage, and Event lengths %https://github.com/JulianBvW/Wearable-Sleep-Event-Detection/blob/main/Notebooks/61_info_results.ipynb
