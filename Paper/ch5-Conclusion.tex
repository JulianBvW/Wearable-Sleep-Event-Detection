In this work we aimed to create an easy to set up and unobtrusive way to diagnose SDB, an illness that, while having significant health implications, is often undiagnosed. We have shown that using only signals from a finger-worn PPG sensor, we can detect SDB with high accuracy. While our method is not perfect and performance of the gold standard PSG is still not reached, we believe that our method is a step in the right direction, helping with screening and pre-diagnosis of SDB.
