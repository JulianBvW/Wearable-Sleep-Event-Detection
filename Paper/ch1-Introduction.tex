\begin{itemize}
    \item What is SDB? Apnea vs Hypopnea? Central vs Obstructive? Mixed apnea hard to detect, therefore not in this study.
    \item SDB is under-diagnosed (x\% of people have it dignosed, expected x\% estimated undiagnosed) but has many potential harms.
    \item AHI and Severity classifications. Just looking at AHI is skewed (FP and FN cancel each other out), so also look at Event-Based metrics (Se, Pr, F1).
    \item Gold standard for detecting it is PSG but it's very obstructive and expensive.
    \item Results \cite{xie2023use} from others.
    \item Goal is to use an easy to setup finger PPG sensor for this task. As single-night Recordings might not be representative, an unobstrusive way could help.
    \item Results from others that use only PPG.
    \item Structure of this work.
